I did ws4 in two sessions. I saved the first session as ws4.txt and second 
session as ws4_2.txt, and then appended ws4_2.txt to ws4.txt.
I did the same thing with the cmds.log file. Also edited the history in the
cmds.log file to keep only commands relevant to this worksheet.

Response to ws4 question
------------------------
The mean helpfulness value was printed on screen using the awk commands. 
They are as follows:
CUSTOMERS/20722084.txt	4.6
CUSTOMERS/37376087.txt	9.1875
CUSTOMERS/41549714.txt	10.0729

PRODUCTS/0345340426.txt	7.47495
PRODUCTS/0373271026.txt	2.55556
PRODUCTS/0446608653.txt	4.02857

Helpfulness value can differ significantly between different customers
and different products. Different customers will have different tastes and also
different expectations. Similarly different products will be used for different
functions so the rating that customers give will be reflection of the 
customers' experience with the product.
